# Minusfetch
lightweight system infomation program, should work with every os, not tested on mac yet. I did this since scratch is boring in computers class

#Installation
command is **pipreqs requirements.txt**
You have to change directory to the Folder that contains Minusfetch
For some reason pipreqs was broken on my linux pc, so if it doesnt work try useing **python -m pipreqs.pipreqs (directory)**
